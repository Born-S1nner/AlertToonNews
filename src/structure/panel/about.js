              It is obvious that I love Webtoon since it begans to become popular in digital media. After having to see such creative work and amazing stories made from lovable Authors, I wanted everyone to see what I experience. However, I ask someone about Webtoon and they reply with "What is Webtoon?" My heart sanked knowing that Webtoon doesn't have such a high recognition such as the anime community or gaming community. I don't want people to be left unkown that such an amazing digital comic that is available in a large variety of language exist. However, I am simply unable to just show everyone the app as it would be disrespectful to take away the magic of Webtoon. Instead, I can update you with the news in order to keep the viewers updated. I hope I did my best to inform the necessary information that you seek about Webtoon.
